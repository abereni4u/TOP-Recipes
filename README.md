# TOP-Recipes
For this project, I've made a webpage that links to different recipes I found on the web, as well as the 
ingredients and steps needed to make them. Click on the dishes you want to make below, 
and it'll take you to a page with more information on that recipe. 

Got better at using Git, terminal commands, and structure for HTML files completing this project.

Adding CSS styling soon
