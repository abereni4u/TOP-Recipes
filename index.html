        <p>This website was made for 
            <strong> 
                <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">
                The Odin Project.</a>
            </strong>
        For this project, I've made a webpage that links to different recipes I found on the web, as well as the 
        ingredients and steps needed to make them. Click on the dishes you want to make below, 
        and it'll take you to a page with more information on that recipe. I like spicy stuff so heads up...
