            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    This cumin-spiced lentils & rice dish is a variation on the BEAN, 
                    GRAIN, AND GREEN MEAL TEMPLATE. Here, lentils are the bean.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is recipe isn't MUJADDARA, since it doesn't come close to 
                    having that dish's deeply caramelized onions or socarrat 
                    (the delightfully crispy rice at the bottom of the pan). 
                    But mujaddara is a very loose source of inspiration for the meal. 
                    I don't caramelize the onions that go into the recipe, but I do brown them a bit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you'll see, the lentils and rice here are pre-cooked. This means 
                    that the cumin-spiced lentils & rice is a good opportunity to practice
                    batch cooking and make ahead skills! Cook the rice and boil the lentils
                    when your schedule allows for it. When it comes time to make this meal,
                    you'll have a fast and flavorful dinner on the table in less than twenty minutes.

                        <li>
                        To make the dressing, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl 
                        or measuring cup and whisk until evenly blended. If the dressing is thicker 
                        than you'd like, whisk in water by the tablespoonful to achieve the desired 
                        consistency. (Stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, 
                        the dressing will keep for 1 week.)

                        <li>
                            Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet or pot over medium heat. 
                            Add the onions. Cook the onions, stirring them often, for about
                            10-12 minutes, or until they're a nice, golden brown. Add the
                            cumin and coriander and stir; then, add the kale. Cook the kale
                            until it's tender, stirring often (about 5 minutes).

                            Heat everything through. Taste the mixture and add salt and pepper 
                            to your liking. Divide onto plates and top with Everyday Lemon Tahini Dressing.
