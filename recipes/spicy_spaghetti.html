                The Naples classic of spaghetti all'aglio, olio, e peperoncino—spaghetti 
                tossed with extra-virgin olive oil in which a bit of garlic and 
                red chili pepper has been sautéed—is one of the simplest, quickest, 
                and yet most satisfying pasta dishes of all. 
                It only takes about 15 minutes to make, including boiling the pasta water, 
                so it's great when you're pressed for time.
