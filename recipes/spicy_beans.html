            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    These Spicy Stovetop Beans are an absolute favorite of mine. 
                    Beans for lunch has been somewhat of a healthy addiction for me lately. 
                    The past few years, really.

                    One pot meals are absolutely my favorite thing these days. 
                    These beans are easily made using one pot and on your stovetop. 
                    I use my fave Staub pot. I love these pots so much that I have four of them. 
                    They are so versatile. I use them for sauteeing, soups, stews, 
                    warming up canned goods in speedy fashion and basically making 
                    just about anything on my stove.

                    This steamy, spiced pot of beans is perfect for a fast and healthy 
                    - and delicious - lunch. I love pairing my beans with tortilla or 
                    tortilla-style chips, or a cornbread muffin. Guacamole or avocado always works too!
